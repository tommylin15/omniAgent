# CI/CD V2 evidence — ACTIVE / PARTIAL

## Source and first Push

- Source commit `a949b758ed366fcc9524170f6e733cd5827a8b90`, real main Push.
- Cloud Build CI `418538b6-83fb-46ae-b069-94ff3708c61c`: FAILURE at step 0.
  Direct Git source and resolved source both equal that full SHA; regional
  `us-central1`, existing `omniagent-ci`, `CLOUD_LOGGING_ONLY`, no source bucket.
- Root cause: SDK method `fetchReadToken` was used as the REST path; the REST
  endpoint is `accessReadToken`. Regression test RED then fix GREEN.
- GitHub Node Core `37721416872`: SUCCESS; Project Hygiene `37721416741`: SUCCESS.
- No V2 image build, candidate deployment or traffic promotion happened in this run.

## Initial resource measurements

- Private repository confirmed; connection `tommy-github` installation COMPLETE.
- CI Push trigger `78b4219e-b65c-4e7f-9d75-0f12f7b87e05`, enabled, `_MODE=ci`, `^main$`.
- Manual Release trigger `14c90fda-6a46-4d04-ae0e-398f4be93fc4`.
- Existing regional build bucket: 1,112,943,932 bytes. Existing legacy US build
  bucket: 3,208,164 bytes. These predate V2; neither was created/deleted here.
- Initial omniAgent registry approximately 1.64 GiB; scanning disabled.
- Actual invoiced cost is not yet obtained; do not report estimates as invoices.

## Explicitly open

Provider bundle absent, human OAuth two-owner evidence missing, durable dispatcher
unimplemented. Canonical release/full live acceptance/CLOSED are not claimed.
