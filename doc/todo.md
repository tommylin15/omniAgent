## UI v1 development kickoff

- [ ] **UI v1 Slice 1 — READY-FOR-CODEX.**
  - Work order: GitHub Issue #1, kickoff comment ID `6036339623`.
  - Start from `main@f21702f829514a72c41586e30b1665258909e94c`.
  - Before source edits, record exact-head Flutter baseline: `flutter pub get`, `flutter analyze lib test`, `flutter test`, `flutter build web`.
  - First source slice: centralized Warm Cozy theme/tokens, sign-in/config state, new-thread empty state, replaceable Twin Beast mascot slot.
  - Presentation layer only; existing Chat API routes/payloads/event/approval/cancel semantics and `assistantProfile=default` must remain unchanged.
  - Exit evidence: exact commit + pre/post command results. Source PASS is not live acceptance.
  - Status is READY-FOR-CODEX, not implemented; this documentation entry must not be counted as feature completion.

## P0 — real Phase 6B blockers

- [ ] **Exact-head CI/test for the deploy candidate.**
  - Node build/tests + Flutter analyze/tests/build tied to one commit.

- [ ] **Create/verify independent dev Chat DB/role and apply 001/002.**
  - Real schema/read-write evidence; no Janus storage mutation.

- [ ] **Deploy Chat API + Flutter candidate without writer cutover.**
  - Immutable revision/image, health/UI/protected API smoke.

- [ ] **Real browser identity + at least two-owner isolation.**
  - Stable issuer+subject mapping; cross-owner thread/event/approval/Skill access rejected.

- [ ] **Implement durable Chat→Gateway dispatcher/worker.**
  - Transactional claim, retry/cancel/crash recovery, authenticated Gateway call, idempotent event append.
  - PostgreSQL remains authoritative queue/turn state.

- [ ] **Implement Credential Resolver and entitlement policy.**
  - Inputs: authenticated owner, provider/runtime, requested credential mode/profile, entitlement.
  - Modes: owner BYOK and entitled platform credential.
  - Raw secret never returned to Flutter or persisted in Chat/event/Skill/lake payloads.

- [ ] **Implement owner BYOK secret lifecycle for enabled providers.**
  - Secure create/replace/revoke/validate through an approved secret store; PostgreSQL keeps only metadata/reference/status.
  - No raw credential in logs or browser storage.

- [ ] **Prove platform-key isolation.**
  - Two owners may use the same platform provider credential while retaining separate threads, summaries, tools, artifacts, approvals, memory/retrieval results and archive records.
  - Unauthorized owner cannot select platform credential.

- [ ] **Complete enabled provider E2E.**
  - Gemini + OpenRouter through real Chat path.
  - Codex requires owner auth plus owner-isolated execution context.
  - Direct Groq is a new implementation item and cannot be tested/claimed until its adapter exists.

- [ ] **Codex owner-isolated execution context.**
  - Isolate equivalent auth/session directory, thread mapping, workspace, environment, process and MCP/tool state per owner.
  - Shared platform Codex authorization must not create shared session/workspace/memory.

- [ ] **Runtime approval/cancel/reconnect/MCP E2E.**

## P1 — data lifecycle and experiment platform

- [ ] **Add direct Groq provider adapter and generic event conversion.**
  - Unit/contract tests + real dev provider probe + full Chat E2E.

- [ ] **Add credential-management API/UI.**
  - Personal vs Platform source visible; full secret never redisplayed.
  - replace/revoke/status/last-validated behaviors.

- [ ] **Define measured hot-data and large-payload thresholds.**
  - Do not hard-code an arbitrary retention period without workload evidence.

- [ ] **Add owner-bound GCS artifact/object tier.**
  - Large immutable message bodies, attachments, tool/worker output and exports.
  - Persist digest/size/media/reference metadata; authorization checked on read.

- [ ] **Build asynchronous Iceberg historical archive.**
  - Archive conversation events, worker/tool executions, provider usage, approval audit and workflow/task history as applicable.
  - Idempotent writes and source/archive reconciliation.
  - Iceberg must not drive live QUEUED/RUNNING/APPROVAL/terminal transitions.

- [ ] **Define/tune Iceberg partition/compaction/snapshot lifecycle.**
  - Start from time transform + bucket/hash(`owner_id`); verify with actual file/query metrics.

- [ ] **Add authorized historical reconstruction path.**
  - UI/Chat API retrieves owner-authorized history via service logic; clients do not directly query the lake.

- [ ] **Evaluate BigLake/BigQuery analytics only with explicit resource/cost approval.**
  - Bounded queries, measurable use case, no accidental production scans.

- [ ] **Replace/upgrade two-second polling with accepted streaming/reconnect behavior.**
  - Persisted cursor remains source of truth.

- [ ] **Complete Tool/MCP, Skill and bounded Data Source management UI/API.**

## P2 — migration/cutover/finalization

- [ ] Historical Janus owner mapping/export-copy-verify only if approved/required.
- [ ] Prove post-cutover rollback/reverse-sync before write switch.
- [ ] Obtain explicit routing/write-ownership cutover approval.
- [ ] Execute cleanup only after replacement is live-accepted.
- [ ] Reconcile active docs with runtime and remove stale current-state claims without erasing history.
- [ ] Phase 9 final acceptance: source + CI + deployment + integration + credential isolation + storage lifecycle + rollback + docs.
